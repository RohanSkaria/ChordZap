# Monorepo for ChordZap

## Implemented: 
- Created a foundation for a shazam style chord view web application. Theres a fully fucnitonal backend and front end. The backend was made using Typescript and Express.js. It is also connected to a MongoDB with API endpoints. The schema includes, song models with chord information, artist details, and meta data. The front end is a react application that provides a UI with 4 main screens - shown below. This implementation includes custom hooks for audio capture, song detection, and tab search.

## ToDo:
- API integration for song detection
- Spotify Integration ? maybe through auth - not sure if this is viable yet
- DB population with actual user/song data instead of mock
- scraper for Ultimate Guitar tabs at minimum
- unit testing for api end points and components
