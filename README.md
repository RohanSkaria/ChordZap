# React Frontend

Built a React movie app for my web dev assignment. Created a movie listing page with search/filter functionality, individual movie detail pages, and routing between them. 

Used React hooks for state management, React Bootstrap for styling, and set up proper testing with React Testing Library. Also implemented fallback images for missing movie posters and got all the components working with mock data.
